# Price Glossary

The Foil protocol and app reference many different types of prices.

* **Resource Price**: The price actually paid for the underlying resource at a given time. For example, if a block on Ethereum mainnet has a base fee per gas of 10 gwei, this would be the resource price for the timestamp on that block. This is represented by a green line in the Foil app.
* **Index Price**: The average resource price over a given period. This doesnâ€™t exist before the start time of the period and is effectively a Settlement Price estimate while the period is in progress. This is represented by a dashed blue line in the Foil app.
* **Market Price**: The price that someone can buy or sell in the Foil protocol. This is represented by red and green candlesticks in the Foil app.
* **Settlement Price**: The Index Price at the end of a period. After the period ends, market participants exit their positions at this price.
* **Trailing Average Resource Price**: The average resource price over a previous duration. This may be useful to see what a Settlement Price would be for a hypothetical period that ended at a given time. This is represented by a solid blue line in the Foil app.
