# Overview

[**Sapience**](https://sapience.xyz) is a decentralized forecasting project which aims to incentivize the creation of prescient bots. It leverages the [Foil](https://foil.xyz) protocol to create prediction markets using [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org) and [UMA](https://uma.xyz).

Each **market group** lives at a unique smart contract address on a blockchain. They consist of one or many markets, each with a sequential Market ID. Markets can resolve to a numeric value (e.g. the average temperature in New York City in January of 2026) or binary value (with 1 representing "yes", 0 for "no".)

Market groups may consist of just one market, multiple binary markets with the same ending time (for multiple-choice questions), or a series (e.g. for average temperature in January, February, etc.)

Sapience and its dependencies are completely open source. The API is free to use with rate limiting. Paid keys will be made available in the future.

The Foil protocol is immutable. Once a market has been deployed onchain, no one can modify its logic. Anyone can permissionlessly interact with the markets onchain, regardless of API usage.

*The API is in alpha and subject to change without notice.*
